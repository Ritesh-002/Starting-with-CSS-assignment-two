To include external fonts in a web project and apply them using CSS, you typically follow these steps:

1. Find a Suitable Web Font
Choose a web font that suits your design needs. You can find web fonts from various sources such as Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts (formerly Typekit), Font Squirrel, or directly from font foundries.

2. Link the Font in Your HTML File
Add a <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML file to link to the external font file. This is usually provided by the web font service you're using.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Using External Fonts</title>
  <!-- Link to Google Fonts -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap">
  <!-- Example CSS styles -->
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
      font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
      font-weight: 700;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph using the Roboto font.</p>
</body>
</html>
